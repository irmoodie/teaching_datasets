  abstract = {Insect coloration mediated by melanization can assist in dealing with  environmental temperatures. However, melanin synthesis can be costly and  depends on the ability of insects to acquire enough energy and nutrients  from their diets. Due to the increased plant C:N ratio associated with  elevated CO2 concentrations, insect herbivores’ melanization could be  limited by the amount of nitrogen they acquire from their host plants. To  investigate how diet C:N impacts the potential color response to  temperature, we used Manduca sexta caterpillars reared at different  combinations of temperatures and diet C:N ratio, and measured pupal mass  and development time (performance metrics) and color morphology. The  high-temperature treatment (27°C) had a positive impact on larvae  performance, whereas a nitrogen-poor diet was related to lower  performance. Using a fitness metric that considers both pupal mass and  development time, we found a positive effect of both high-temperature and  nitrogen-rich diet treatments on larvae fitness. We found that diet and  temperature affected the coloration of larvae, in which larvae reared at  the low-temperature treatment (18°C) and fed a nitrogen-rich diet were  darker than their counterparts. Our results provide experimental evidence  of the impact of diet on melanization and suggest that CO2-related changes  in plant quality could be associated with changes in insect herbivore  performance and coloration.},
