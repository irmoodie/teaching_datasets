  abstract = {Adaptation to new ecological niches is known to spur population  diversification and may lead to speciation if gene flow is ceased. While  adaptation to the same ecological niche is expected to be parallel, it is  more difficult to predict whether selection against maladaptive  hybridization in secondary sympatry results in parallel divergence also in  traits that are not directly related to the ecological niches. Such  parallelisms in response to selection for reproductive isolation can be  identified through estimating parallelism in reproductive character  displacement across different zones of secondary contact. Here, we use a  host shift in the phytophagous peacock fly Tephritis conura, with both  host races represented in two geographically separate areas East and West  of the Baltic Sea to investigate convergence in morphological adaptations.  We asked i) if there are consistent morphological adaptations to a host  plant shift and ii) if the response to secondary sympatry with the  alternate host race is parallel across contact zones. We found  surprisingly low and variable, albeit significant, divergence between host  races. Only one trait, the length of the female ovipositor, which serves  an important function in the interaction with the hosts, was consistently  different between host races. Instead, co-existence with the other host  race significantly affected the degree of morphological divergence, but  the divergence was largely driven by different traits in different contact  zones. Thus, local stochastic fixation or reinforcement could generate  trait divergence, and additional evidence is needed to conclude whether  divergence is locally adaptive.},
